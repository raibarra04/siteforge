# Siteforge
#### Siteforge is a static site generator that converts simple content files, like Markdown, into fully-formed HTML websites. Siteforge automates website creation, making deploying fast, secure, and customizable sites easy! 

## Motivation
As I worked on a static site, I sighed, realizing how much HTML I needed to write. I knew as the site became larger, it would quickly become harder to read and update. I thought, why can't generating static sites be simple and quick? Could I use Markdown to generate a website? How does one build a site from markdown? How can I define how that markdown is interpreted? What other ways can I optimize this process?

This is Siteforge! By providing a flexible templating engine and a streamlined Markdown parsing process, Siteforge makes building static sites quickly and effortlessly achievable.
